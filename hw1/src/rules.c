/*
 * Rule management.
 *
 * Conceptually, a rule has the form:
 *
 *    H ==> B1 B2 ... Bn
 *
 * where H is a nonterminal symbol, called the "head" of the rule,
 * and B1 B2 ... Bn is a list of symbols called the "body" of the rule.
 * The symbols in the body can be either terminal symbols or nonterminal symbols.
 * The idea of a rule is that it specifies a substitution that can be
 * performed, in which an instance of the head of the rule is expanded
 * by replacing it by an instance of the body of the rule.
 *
 * Here we don't introduce a separate structure for rules, but instead use
 * the existing SYMBOL structure to represent them.  A rule is represented
 * by a circular, doubly linked list of SYMBOL structures (representing the
 * body of the list), with an additional SYMBOL structure (representing the
 * head of the list) used as a "sentinel" that connects between the first
 * symbol in the body of the list and the last.
 *
 *    H <-> B1 <-> B2 <-> ... <-> Bn
 *    ^                           ^
 *    |                           |
 *    +---------------------------+
 *
 * The "next" and "prev" fields of the SYMBOL structure are used to create the
 * doubly linked list.  The sentinel node H is identifiable by the fact that it
 * has a non-NULL "rule" field that points back to itself.  Nonterminal nodes
 * in the body of the list may also have non-NULL pointers in their rule field,
 * but these will point to the heads of other rules, not back to the symbols
 * themselves.
 *
 * Rules are also maintained in a list of all rules, which is also a circular,
 * doubly linked list, but it uses the "nextr" and "prevr" fields in the SYMBOL
 * structure rather than the "next" and "prev" fields that are used within a rule.
 * The list is accessed via the "main_rule" variable, which points to the
 * head of a rule.  The heads of other rules in the list are accessed by following
 * the nextr and prevr pointers starting from the head of the main rule.
 * The main rule is not used as a special sentinel; it is simply an ordinary rule
 * like the others in the list.  When traversing the list forward and backward,
 * one can use the main_rule variable to identify when the beginning or end of
 * the list has been reached.
